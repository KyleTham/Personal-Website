The zip file contains a couple additional files on top of the 7 minimum we needed, where the minimum included:
Resume.html
Transcript.html
prj1.html
prj2.html
jpeg file of myself
MP4 Video of Self Introduction
and this file.

There are two additional files, which provide additional information about the projects that I have linked. They are 3 pdf files, and one additional html file, which are named:
prj1report.pdf
prj2report.pdf
prj3report.pdf
prj3.html

In addition, the password to the transcript is 'frankbutt'.

All the html was created and edited in Sublime Text.

The google map shows a marker on where I live currently in San Jose. I am originally from Sacramento, California, though.

If there are any problems, my email is kylemtham@gmail.com
