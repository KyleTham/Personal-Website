	<h1> Database Project</h1>
	<p>Project for: CS 157A Database Management Systems
	</div>
	<h1> Overview </h1>
	<p> A team that included myself along with two others were assigned to create a database system where Users interact with the database by using certain functions. An idea was brainstormed by each of us, and we came up with three different ideas: I proposed we create a platform where users can buy games - basically like Steam, a digital distribution platform where users can purchase video games. My teammates suggested that we could create a platform that would be similar to Yelp, and a platform that would be similar to Amazon. We ended up designing the game distribution platform.
	<h2> Requirements </h2>
	<ul>
	<li> A minimum of 5 tables that are relational to each other in some way. </li>
	<li>15 Distinct Functions for Users, excluding database admin functions. </li>
	<li> At least one trigger involved in the database. </li>
	<h2> Features </h2>
	<p> We created 6 total relational tables, which included:
		<ul>
			<li> User </li>
			<li> Credit Card </li>
			<li> Game </li>
			<li> Review </li>
			<li> Publisher </li>
			<li> Owned Library </li>
		</ul>
		Owned library is relational to User and Game to their respective ID's.
		<br>
		Publisher is relational to game, where publisher is the publisher of the game.
		<br>
		Review is relational to User and Game on their ID's.
		<br>
		Game references publisher.
		<br>
		User references Credit Card on their ID, name, and credit card number.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p> For the 15 user functions, what we included and came together to create the functions users would most need:
		<ul>
		<li>Seeing the ratings of games in order from highest to lowest (5 being the highest, 1 being the lowest)</li>
		<li> Sort games by price</li>
		<li> Search a game by the name</li>
		<li> Search games made by a certain publisher</li>
		<li> Purchase a game</li>
		<li> Check which games they own</li>
		<li> Deposit money/funds into the platform</li>
		<li> Insert their credit card info into their account</li>
		<li> Reset their password</li>
		<li> Create an account</li>
		<li> Find the user who has bought the most games</li>
		<li> Add a review to a game</li>
		<li> Find a game that has no reviews yet</li>
		<li> Edit a review that they have written</li>
		<li> Deleting their reviews</li>
		</ul>
