	<h1>Cost-Reduction Plan</h1>
	<p>Project for: Summer 2018 Internship - National Teen Leadership Program
	</div>
	<h1> Overview </h1>
	<p> For the non-profit organization that I was interning at for the summer, one of the biggest problems I noticed was funding. The organization barely had enough money to host the leadership camps they were founded upon, as well as funding the organizations workers such as the Executive Director and the Operations Manager. I took it upon myself to propose an idea where I wanted to do research to find different programs from the current ones they were using to cut expenses. I noticed that the donor management platform, which is used to keep track of who donates to the camp, was way too expensive. Although it had many nice features, they were things that the organization could not necessarily spend luxury one; they were barely making ends meet! So, I researched different donor management platforms along with their pro's and con's and compared the cheapest but most functional/effective one that would work for the problem given to the one that was currently used. You can find the whole report below! </p>

	At the end of my research, I was able to find a platform that took a little more man power to find the things that the old one had found, such as fancy graphs and such. Annually, it would save $3,000 to the organization, which was a lot and a success to me considering the fact that the organization needed any money and savings that could be afforded.
